### Notes:
A few things to know before downloading:
 - Best to start after the game is loaded, not required, but old mumble data could send you under the sea before you load in.
 - ~~The music loop has a gap, I know, your immersion is ruined.~~
 - Max volume attempts to limit how loud Sebastian sings, but that's easier said then done.
 - You wont get banned for using this, it just uses the public Mumble API link to do what it need to do.

Got a suggestion/improvement? Feel free to submit a pull request!
